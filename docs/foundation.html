<h1>Foundation</h1>
<p>Key fundamental capabilities of the UI library.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The library follows a native-first architecture.</p>
<p>The library does not use Shadow DOM.</p>
<p>The library does not rely on CSS classes.</p>

<h2>Styling</h2>
<p>All components are customizable via CSS.</p>
<p>Components fully support both LTR and RTL directions.</p>

<h2>ARIA</h2>
<p>Most ARIA attributes are set automatically to reflect correct roles and component states.</p>
<p>In some cases, <code>aria-label</code> will need to be set manually.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Interactive elements support keyboard navigation: Tab to move forward, Shift + Tab to move backward, Enter or Space to trigger actions, and arrow keys where contextually relevant (e.g., in tabs).</p>
